"WGMS-mean_ba","A WGMS in situ (glaciological) glacier mass-balance series aggregated as a mean balance time series (used by GlaMBIE primarily for interannual variability).","Glaciological observations.","WGMS glaciological observations / FoG-based products as used in GlaMBIE (see WGMS references in the paper and the GlaMBIE WGMS data release)."
"UZH_GlaciolSineWeve","A derived “regional glaciological time series” used for temporal handling in GlaMBIE workflows (the paper describes downscaling glaciological series from seasonal to monthly using an analytical approach for hydrological↔calendar-year handling).","Internal/derived glaciological support series used in processing (temporal correction), rather than a primary remote-sensing method.","Cite the GlaMBIE dataset/paper, and (for the downscaling method) Zemp, M. & Welty, E. “Temporal downscaling of glaciological mass balance using seasonal observations.”Journal of Glaciology(2023)."
"Sasgen_AWIarc_RL01_2","A GRACE/GRACE-FO gravimetry solution associated with the AWI (Alfred Wegener Institute) group led by Sasgen, used as one of the gravimetry contributions in GlaMBIE.","Gravimetry.","Sasgen, I. et al. “Arctic glaciers record wavier circumpolar winds.”Nature Climate Change(2022)."

"Gardner2013_icesat","An input linked to the widely used reconciled estimate of glacier contribution to sea-level rise for 2003–2009 (the paper cites this as a key earlier synthesis), and in the GlaMBIE context this appears as a contributed time series product (dataset ID includes “icesat” in its name).","Hybrid/synthesis-type contribution referenced in GlaMBIE’s background literature (the paper treats such combined-method products as “hybrid estimates” when submitted as inputs).","Gardner, A.

"Treichler_ICESat","An ICESat laser-altimetry-based glacier change estimate (dataset name indicates ICESat) associated with Treichler; ICESat-era altimetry is explicitly listed among the altimetry inputs used by GlaMBIE.","Altimetry (laser altimetry, ICESat era).","Treichler, D., Kääb, A., Salzmann, N. & Xu, C.-Y. “Recent glacier and lake changes in High Mountain Asia and their relation to precipitation changes.”The Cryosphere(2019)."
